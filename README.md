# PackRat

## Project Overview

### Vision Statement

A comprehensive trip-based packing list application that helps travelers organize their packing needs by trip, day, and event type. The app simplifies the packing process by allowing users to create detailed itineraries, leverage reusable templates, and generate consolidated packing lists with quantity aggregation and progress tracking.

### Problem Statement

Travelers often struggle with:

- Forgetting essential items when packing
- Over-packing or under-packing for different trip segments
- Manually calculating quantities needed across multiple days
- Reorganizing packing lists for different types of trips and activities
- Keeping track of what's already been packed

### Solution

A smart packing list app that organizes items by trips and days, uses customizable event templates, automatically calculates item quantities, and provides an intuitive checking system for packing progress.

## Core User Flow

### 1. Trip Setup

- **Create New Trip**: Users initiate a new trip with basic information
- **Trip Details Input**:
  - Departure location (From)
  - Destination location (To)
  - Travel dates (Start and End)
  - Trip notes/description
  - Packing days count (may differ from trip duration)

### 2. Day-by-Day Planning

- **Daily Itinerary Creation**: For each packing day, users can:
  - Add specific events/activities
  - Select from saved event templates
  - Manually add custom items
  - Organize items by event type

### 3. Item Management

- **Event-Based Organization**: Items grouped by events within each day
- **Template Integration**: Quick addition of items via event templates
- **Custom Additions**: Manual item entry with quantities

### 4. List Aggregation

- **Quantity Calculation**: Automatic summation of identical items across all days
- **Consolidated View**: Single comprehensive packing list showing total quantities needed
- **Category Organization**: Items grouped by type (clothing, toiletries, electronics, etc.)

### 5. Packing Progress

- **Checklist Interface**: Users can mark items as packed
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indication of packing completion
- **Trip Readiness**: Overall trip packing status

### Architecture Considerations

### Data Models

```
Trip {
  id, name, from, to, startDate, endDate,
  packingDays, notes, createdAt, updatedAt
}

Day {

}

Event {
  id, dayId, templateId?, name, items[],
  startTime?, endTime?, notes
}

Item {
  id, name, quantity, category, priority,
  isPacked, notes, imageUrl?
}

Template {
  id, name, category, items[],
  isCustom, createdBy, popularity
}

```
